The arrangements for the Harvest after the black moon are almost done.

The bullshit on the TV and internet can just help our goals.
Let those lower beings talk about chips, graphene, 5G or whichever shit they want on Covid and the vaccines.
It’s just the perfect smokescreen for us to silently harvest the return of the King in Yellow to carcosa.

Concerning the uncontrolled sources you mention, we believe any possible disturbance was eliminated.
The were only 3 sources for the name of Khofith:
      </pre>
      <tt>- The letter from L. Caelius Rufus, eliminated in ‘61 thanks to Spanish fascists.</tt><br />
      <tt>- Codex Milesius, burnt during the coups in Turkey in the ‘80s</tt><br />
      <tt>- The paper from Armitage: Only <a href="/paper.html">one copy</a> remains in Section 9. Just to remind us of Dunwich.</tt></br>
      <pre>
Be assured, blood will drip and Khofith will awake.

                            iä iä Khofith Nyantin!

How are the arrangements for the Harvest coming?
The background noise related to the vaccine is growing in the unofficial circles in the internet, even reaching the TV.
Besides, I hope the name of khofith will not be re-discovered by any scholar from any source uncontrolled by your section. The wait was long since the Dunwich fiasco in 1928, and we cannot afford a new Armitage, damned be his soul.
